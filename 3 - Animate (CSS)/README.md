# Animating with CSS3

Animate page elements using the CSS3 `animate` property and `@keyframes`.

## What we did 

We wrote the code using jsbin.com, a live interactive in-browser HTML/CSS/JS
editor.

You can find comments inline in the examples.

* [Simple zoom animation using scale](https://jsbin.com/tesusu/edit?html,css,output) - the first thing we did to get started
* [More exciting stuff](https://jsbin.com/zafunuw/3/edit?html,css,output) - more
  examples working with keyframes and animation syntax
* [Bounce](https://jsbin.com/tizoxis/3/edit?html,css,output) - slightly more
  advanced multi-object animation we did toward the end of the workshop
